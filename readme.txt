Project 02B June 08 2018

We finished all the basic requirements and our deliverables meet all the basic specifications. We attempted to go for extra credit but decided to stop after hitting some obstacles since all our members have other commitments. 

In the code that we are handing in, we commented out some codes that were used to speed up our implementations such as saving and loading intermediate results. 

Most of our results seem reasonable except for the data by state. Our result data for comment positiveness and negativeness by state seems correct but when using the template to plot the result in the graph, all states are in the same color. We suspect that there is something wrong in our graphs-plotting code but we couldn't locate the error. 

Thank you!
